Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install plants_and_minerals

## Usage

There are more details about plants from a plant API "Trele.io", which you
will need to visit to get your own token. The mineral names scraped from a 
website: "http://webmineral.com/data/index.html" 

You can learn the plant's common name, scientific name, family, genus, and link to view
an image.  

Eventually, all plants will be implemented and have an additional detail about its edible part
if it has one. Animals will also be included. The planet program will continue to acquire knowledge
about everything on our planet and then beyond...
